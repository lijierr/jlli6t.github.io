# gccov

### Description
**[gccov]()** is a tiny tool used for visualization of GC and coverage of assemblies.

### Example
We are interested in the distribution of GC & coverage of two genomes among the whole assemblies.
Blue and red bubbles are representing genome A and B, respectively. It is very clear in the below figure that these two genomes share similar GC content and coverage.

![gccov_p1]({{ 'assets/picbed/proj/gccov_p0.png' | relative_url }})

When you zoom in, you can clearly see the difference between these two genomes.
